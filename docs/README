About
-----

checkcites is a Lua script written for the sole purpose of detecting
unused or undefined references from both LaTeX auxiliary or
bibliography files. We use 'unused reference' to refer to the
reference present the bibliography file -- with the '.bib'
extension -- but not cited in the '.tex' file. The 'undefined
reference' is exactly the opposite, that is, the items cited in the
'.tex' file, but not present in the '.bib' file.

The original idea came from a question posted in the TeX.sx community
about how to check which bibliography entries were not used. We
decided to write a script to check references. We opted for Lua,
since it's a very straightforward language and it has an interpreter
available on every modern TeX distribution.

Installation
------------

1. Create a new directory named 'checkcites' inside the 'scripts'
   directory of your TEXMF tree and copy the 'checkcites.lua' inside
   the new directory. In TeX Live, the new directory would be:

   texlive/<year>/texmf/scripts/checkcites

2. Rebuild the filename databases with the proper distro tool,
   e.g, running 'mktexlsr'.

3. Create a symbolic link to the newly created script inside
   the 'bin' directory of your TeX distro. In TeX Live, the
   full path is:

   texlive/<year>/bin/<arch>

   For TeX Live:

   Win32: make a copy of 'runscript.exe' inside the very same
          location (i.e, 'bin/win32') and rename it to
          'checkcites.exe'.

   Linux: create a symbolic link (i.e, 'ln -s') inside the 'bin'
          directory, targeting the script set in #1. Name it
          'checkcites' and give it proper execute ('x') permission.

Usage
-----

The script is pretty simple to use. The only requirement is a recent
TeX distribution, such as TeX Live. Then run checkcites:

$ checkcites

It will print the script usage. The only required argument is the
'.aux' file which is generated when you compile your '.tex' file.
If your main document is named 'foo.tex', you will have a 'foo.aux'
file too. To run the script on that file, go with:

$ checkcites foo.aux

checkcites allows an additional argument that will tell it how to
behave. For example

$ checkcites --unused foo.aux

will make the script only look for unused references in your '.bib'
file. The argument order doesn't matter, you can also run

$ checkcites foo.aux --unused

and get the same behaviour. Similarly, you can use

$ checkcites --undefined foo.aux

to make the script only look for undefined references in your
'.tex' file. If you want checkcites to look for both unused and
undefined references, go with

$ checkcites --all foo.aux

If no special argument is provided, --all is set as default.
